<!--Take the solution of the previous task Show an alert. Modify it by extracting the script content into

<!--Open the page, ensure that the alert works.-->


<html>

<body>

<!--If we have a lot of JavaScript code, we can put it into a separate file.-->

<!--Script files are attached to HTML with the src attribute:-->

<!--If your script.js file is in the same folder as your HTML file:-->
<script src="main.js">

    alert("Hello World ignored!");  // the content is ignored, because src is set

</script>

<!-- Use this when the script is hosted on a server or a Content Delivery Network (CDN)-->
    <!--<script src="https://example.com/js/script.js"></script>-->

<!--We must choose either an external <script src="â€¦"> or a regular <script> with code.-->
<!--The example above can be split into two scripts to work-->

<script>
    alert("Hello World!");
</script>

<script src="main.js"></script>
